# Barker's Adventure: Progress and Next Steps

## Summary of Progress
Here’s what we’ve accomplished so far in *Barker’s Adventure*:
- **Player Movement:** Implemented basic movement and collision detection.
- **Companions:** Added Nina (dog) and Alice (cat) to follow the player.
- **Tilemap:** Created a basic tilemap for the game world, with recent adjustments to tile positions.
- **Enemies:** Added enemy spawning with basic AI (e.g., Octoroks).
- **Doors and Transitions:** Implemented doors that unlock when all enemies in a room are defeated, plus a fade effect for smooth room transitions.
- **Bug Fixes:** Corrected door unlock logic, fixed tilemap issues in `world.py`, and improved debugging output.

We’re off to a solid start, and the core gameplay loop is taking shape!

## Required Assets
To bring your new ideas to life, we’ll need some fresh assets. Here’s the list:
- **Tiles:**
  - Water tiles (for rivers or lakes).
  - Tree tiles (for forests or obstacles).
  - Bridge tiles (to cross water).
  - Town tiles (buildings, paths, etc.).
- **Enemies:**
  - Sprites for new enemy types (e.g., skeletons, bats, ranged attackers).
- **Powerups/Items:**
  - Powerup sprites (e.g., projectile upgrades, health boosts).
  - Weapon sprites (e.g., sword, bow, bigger fireball).
- **UI Elements:**
  - Gold coin sprite (for enemy drops).
  - HUD sprite for the current projectile (e.g., fireball icon).
  - Stat/level-up UI (e.g., health bars, experience bars).
  - Inventory slots for weapons.
- **Town and NPCs:**
  - Building sprites (shops, houses).
  - NPC sprites (shopkeepers, quest givers).
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Weather effects (rain, fog).
  - Boss enemy sprite and attack effects.

These assets will support the town, powerups, inventory, and more enemies you’ve got in mind.

## Progress Tracker (20 New Items)
Here’s a new list of 20 tasks to enhance the game. I’ve included your unfinished items (17–19), your specific requests (walls, enemies, powerups, etc.), and some extra ideas inspired by *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past*, *Enter the Gungeon*, *Dark Souls*, *Final Fantasy 6*, and *Earthbound*.

   Prevent the player from walking through walls, trees, or water tiles.

   After a set number of kills, Nina or Alice drops a powerup (e.g., bigger/stronger projectiles).
