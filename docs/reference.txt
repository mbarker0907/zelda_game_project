2. Reference Guide: Key Methods, Functions, and Variables
To help you understand the codebase, I’ll provide a reference guide of the most important methods, functions, and variables in your game. I’ll focus on the core components that drive the game’s functionality, explaining what they do and why they’re important. This will help you study the code without getting overwhelmed by every single detail.

Overview
The game is structured around several classes:

Game (main.py): Manages the game loop and state.
Player (player.py): Controls the player character.
World (world.py): Manages the game map and environment.
Enemy (enemy.py): Handles enemies and their behavior.
Companion (companion.py): Manages the cat and dog companions.
NPC (npc.py): Handles NPCs like the shopkeeper and quest giver.
Chest (chest.py): Manages chests that contain items.
Bush (bush.py): Handles destructible bushes.
Projectile (projectile.py): Manages projectiles (player and enemy).
HUD (hud.py): Displays the heads-up display (health, inventory, etc.).
I’ll list key elements from each class, focusing on what’s most relevant for understanding the game’s mechanics.

Game Class (main.py)
Variables:
self.state (string): Tracks the current game state ("title", "playing", "shopping", "game_over", "paused"). Used to determine what to update and draw.
self.debug_mode (boolean): Toggles debug mode (F1 key). When True, hitboxes are drawn in red.
self.music_volume (float): Controls the background music volume (0.0 to 1.0). Adjusted in the pause menu.
self.player (Player object): The player character instance.
self.world (World object): The game world instance.
self.hud (HUD object): The HUD instance.
self.enemies (list): List of Enemy objects in the current room.
self.bushes (list): List of Bush objects in the current room.
self.npcs (list): List of NPC objects in the current room.
self.cat (Companion object): The cat companion.
self.dog (Companion object): The dog companion.
Methods:
init_game(): Initializes the game by creating the player, world, HUD, and companions, and spawning room objects. Called when starting a new game or restarting after a game over.
spawn_room_objects(): Spawns enemies, bushes, and NPCs based on the current room. For example, Room 0 has NPCs, Room 1 has enemies and bushes, Room 3 has a boss.
handle_input(): Processes user input (keyboard, joystick). Handles state transitions (e.g., ESC to pause), player actions (e.g., SPACE to shoot), and debug mode toggle (F1).
update(): Updates the game state when self.state == "playing". Updates the player, companions, enemies, projectiles, and world (e.g., day/night cycle).
draw(): Renders the game based on the current state. Draws the title screen, game world, HUD, and debug hitboxes if enabled.
run(): The main game loop. Calls handle_input(), update(), and draw() each frame, and maintains the frame rate (FPS from config.py).
Why It’s Important: The Game class is the heart of your game, orchestrating everything. Understanding its state management (self.state) and how it coordinates updates and rendering will help you add new features (e.g., a new game state like "inventory").

Player Class (player.py)
Variables:
self.rect (pygame.Rect): The player’s position and size (24x24 pixels). Used for movement and collision detection.
self.health (int): The player’s current health (starts at 5).

self.level (int): The player’s level (starts at 1).
self.experience (int): The player’s current experience points.
self.experience_to_next_level (int): Experience needed to level up (increases by 1.5x each level).
self.gold (int): The player’s gold (used to buy items from the shopkeeper).
self.inventory (list): List of items the player has (e.g., "key", "ice_bolt", "bomb").
self.weapons (list): List of available weapons (["sword", "bow"]).
self.current_weapon_index (int): Index of the current weapon in self.weapons.
self.projectiles (list): List of Projectile objects the player has fired.
self.direction (float): The player’s facing direction in degrees (0 = right, 90 = up, etc.).
Methods:
current_weapon (property): Returns the current weapon based on self.current_weapon_index.
move(keys, window_width, window_height): Moves the player based on keyboard input (WASD or arrow keys). Updates self.direction and self.rect.
move_with_velocity(vx, vy, window_width, window_height): Moves the player based on joystick input. Used for gamepad support.
_apply_movement(dx, dy, window_width, window_height): Applies movement (dx, dy) to the player’s position, checking for walls and boundaries.
_handle_room_transition(): Handles room transitions when the player steps on a door tile (tile type 2).
shoot_projectile(): Fires a projectile (e.g., arrow, ice_bolt, bomb) based on the current weapon and inventory.
update(): Updates the player’s state (e.g., shoot cooldown, level-up if enough experience).
update_projectiles(window_width, window_height): Updates the player’s projectiles, removing them if they go off-screen.
take_damage(): Reduces the player’s health by 1.
switch_weapon(weapon_index): Switches the player’s current weapon (e.g., 1 for sword, 2 for bow).
draw(screen, window_width, window_height): Draws the player and their projectiles on the screen.
Why It’s Important: The Player class controls the main character, so understanding how movement, combat, and leveling work will help you tweak gameplay (e.g., add new weapons, adjust speed).

World Class (world.py)

drop_gold(x, y, amount): Drops gold at (x, y) with the specified amount.
drop_item(x, y, item_type): Drops an item (e.g., "bomb") at (x, y).
Why It’s Important: The World class manages the game environment, including the map, room transitions, and day/night cycle. Understanding how tiles and objects are handled will help you design new rooms or add new environmental features.

Enemy Class (enemy.py)

is_dead(): Returns True if the enemy is dead (health <= 0 and death animation is complete).
draw(screen): Draws the enemy, applying visual effects (red flash for damage, blue tint for frozen).
Why It’s Important: Enemies drive the game’s combat. Understanding how they move, take damage, and apply status effects will help you add new enemy types or mechanics (e.g., a new status effect like burning).

Companion Class (companion.py)

level_up(): Increases the companion’s level, speed, and resets experience.
draw(screen): Draws the companion, applying visual effects (yellow flash for attacks, green flash for level-up).
Why It’s Important: Companions add a unique mechanic to the game. Understanding how they follow and attack will help you enhance their abilities (e.g., add special attacks).

NPC Class (npc.py)

3. Tips for Learning and Building the Game
Since you’re new to coding and want to learn while making a badass game, I’ll share some strategies to balance learning with fun, and optimize our collaboration using AI.

Learning Tips
Start with Small Experiments:
Pick one class or mechanic to focus on (e.g., the Player class). Try modifying something simple, like increasing PLAYER_SPEED in config.py to see how it affects movement.
Add a small feature, like a new item in chest.py (e.g., a "speed_boost" that increases self.speed for 10 seconds). This will help you understand how classes interact.
Use the Reference Guide:
Refer to the guide above to understand what each method does. For example, if you want to add a new weapon, look at Player.shoot_projectile() and Projectile to see how projectiles are created and updated.
Focus on one class at a time. Start with Player, then move to Enemy, and so on.
Debug with Print Statements:
Add print() statements to see what’s happening. For example, in Player.move(), add print(self.direction) to see how the player’s direction changes as you move.
This will help you understand the flow of the code and debug issues.
Break Down Complex Methods:
Some methods, like Game.update(), do a lot. Break them into smaller pieces in your mind. For example, Game.update() updates the player, then companions, then enemies, etc. Focus on one section at a time.
Learn Pygame Basics:
Since the game uses Pygame, understanding its core concepts will help. Focus on:
pygame.Rect: Used for positions and collisions (e.g., self.rect in Player).
pygame.Surface: Used for drawing (e.g., self.screen in Game).
pygame.event.get(): Used for input handling (e.g., in Game.handle_input()).
Watch a short Pygame tutorial (e.g., on YouTube) to get familiar with these concepts.
Don’t Overwhelm Yourself:
You don’t need to understand every line of code right away. Focus on the big picture (e.g., how the Game class runs the game loop) and dive into details as needed.
If something feels too technical (e.g., sprite sheet animation in Enemy), ask me to explain it in simpler terms or focus on a different part of the game.
